You may join the Velero community and contribute in many different ways, including helping us design or test new features. For any significant feature we consider adding, we start with a design document. You may find a list of currently in progress new feature designs here: https://github.com/heptio/velero/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3ADesign. Feel free to review and help us with your input.
