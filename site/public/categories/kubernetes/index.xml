      <title>Velero v1.1 backing up and restoring Stateful apps on vSphere</title>

      <description>Velero version 1.1 provides support to backup applications orchestrated on upstream Kubernetes running natively on vSphere. This post will provide detailed information on how to use Velero v1.1 to backup and restore a stateful application (Cassandra) that is running in a Kubernetes cluster deployed on vSphere. At this time there is no vSphere plugin for snapshotting stateful applications during a Velero backup. In this case, we rely on a third party program called restic to copy the data contents from Persistent Volumes.</description>

      <description>Velero version 1.1 provides support to backup Kubernetes applications deployed on vSphere. This post will provide detailed information on how to install and configure Velero to backup and restore a stateless application (nginx) that is running in Kubernetes on vSphere. At this time there is no vSphere plugin for snapshotting stateful applications on vSphere during a Velero backup. In this case, we rely on a third party program called restic. However this post does not include an example of how to backup a stateful application.</description>

      <description>Velero is an open source tool to safely back up, recover, and migrate Kubernetes clusters and persistent volumes. It works both on premises and in a public cloud. Velero consists of a server process running as a deployment in your Kubernetes cluster and a command-line interface (CLI) with which DevOps teams and platform operators configure scheduled backups, trigger ad-hoc backups, perform restores, and more.
What Makes Velero Stand Out? Unlike other tools which directly access the Kubernetes etcd database to perform backups and restores, Velero uses the Kubernetes API to capture the state of cluster resources and to restore them when necessary.</description>
