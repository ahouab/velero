      <description>The Velero team is excited to announce the launch of Velero v1.4.0! This release is one of our largest since v1.0.0, with many of our new features coming from community contributors.
Beta CSI Support Velero v1.4.0 now extends Velero’s support for snapshotting beyond Velero’s native VolumeSnapshotter plugins to include beta support for the Kubernetes Container Storage Interface volume snapshotting capabilities.
The Container Storage Interface (CSI) is a way for container orchestrators such as Kubernetes to provide a standard interface for storage systems, without having to create drivers for each orchestration system.</description>

      <description>Velero continues to evolve with the release of version 1.2. With this release, we’ve focused on extracting in-tree cloud provider plugins into their own repositories, making further usability improvements to the restic integration, preparing for the general availability of Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs) by adding a structural schema to our CRDs, and many other new features and usability improvements.

      <description>We’ve made big strides in improving Velero. Since our release of version 1.0 in May 2019, we have been hard at work improving our restic support and planning for the future of Velero. In addition, we’ve seen some helpful contributions from the community that will make life easier for all of our users. Also, the Velero community has reached 100 contributors!
For this release, we’ve focused on improving Velero’s restic integration: making repository locks shorter lived, giving more visibility into restic repositories when migrating clusters, and expanding support to more volume types.</description>

      <description>Just three months after the release of Velero 0.11, the community’s momentum continues with the delivery of the landmark version 1.0 release. This significant release improves the installation experience, Helm support, the plugin system, and overall stability. We want to thank the community and the team, and acknowledge all of their hard work and amazing contributions to this major milestone.
Data protection is always a chief concern for application owners who want to make sure that they can restore a cluster to a known good state, recover from a crashed cluster, or migrate to a new environment.</description>
