Added `<backup name>`-itemsnapshots.json.gz to the backup format.  This file exists
when item snapshots are taken and contains an array of volume.Itemsnapshots 
containing the information about the snapshots.  This will not be used unless 
upload progress monitoring and item snapshots are enabled and an ItemSnapshot 
plugin is used to take snapshots.

Also added DownloadTargetKindBackupItemSnapshots for retrieving the signed URL to download only the `<backup name>`-itemsnapshots.json.gz part of a backup for use by 
`velero backup describe`.
