Added functionality to deploy a specific Restic encryption password.
The behavior currently is that the Restic encryption password is hard-coded. I've implemented that the 
encryption password can be controlled by an environment variable "RESTIC_PASSWORD". If the environment
variable is not set, the default password would be set to the old hard-coded password. Because of this,
there should be no problem for users that do not set this variable.
I've added this functionality because we don't want to use the default password for the restic encryption.
