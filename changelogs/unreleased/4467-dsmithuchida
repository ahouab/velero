Added Upload Progress Monitoring and ItemSnapshotters.  This enables monitoring
of snapshots that need additional processing such as an upload to an object 
store after the snapshot is taken.  Backups are now split into two phases with
the new uploading phase happening after the main part of the backup is complete.
Once a backup has entered the uploading phase, another backup can be executed.
On restart of the server, any backups that are in an Uploading phase will
continue to be monitored.

Added metrics for Item Snapshots in a backup

    item_snapshot_attempt_total - number of item snapshots attempted in a backup
    item_snapshot_success_total - number of successful item snapshots in a backup
    item_snapshot_failure_total - number of failed item snapshots in a backup

    Success requires that both the snapshot and the upload succeeded.  These stats
    are set when the backup moves to a terminal phase.

Added upload-progress-check-interval flag to control how often snapshots are checked for upload progress - defaults to 1 minute

This feature is currently enabled with the EnableUploadProgress flag.  It
also requires ItemSnapshot plugins.
