Modify generated from schedule's backup name timestamp to UTC timestamp.
Fix https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/4279
When backup is created from schedule, and the backup name is not specified, 
a containing-timestamp generated name will be used. 
Due to velero client not set timezone to UTC, a local timezone will be used for the generated name.
