# Release cycle and process
Velero team is aiming for 3 releases per year, but will commit to two releases per year with few patch releases in between.
Planing for new release starts with relabeling all candidates that were not completed in the current release - in example [1.11-candidates](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A1.11-candidate) and labeling all the new for the upcoming release.

In parallel we start a [discussion](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/discussions?discussions_q=label%3ASurvey) to collect new ideas, proposals, needs and new contributors.

# Versioning and Release
This document describes the versioning and release process of Velero. This document is a living document, contents will be updated according to each releases.

## Releases
Velero releases will be versioned using dotted triples, similar to [Semantic Version](http://semver.org/). For this specific document, we will refer to the respective components of this triple as `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. The version number may have additional information, such as "-rc1,-rc2,-rc3" to mark release candidate builds for earlier access. Such releases will be considered as "pre-releases".

### Major and Minor Releases
Major and minor releases of Velero will be branched from `main` when the release reaches to `RC(release candidate)` state. The branch format should follow `release-<major>.<minor>.0`. For example, once the release `v1.0.0` reaches to RC, a branch will be created with the format `release-1.0.0`. When the release reaches to `GA(General Available)` state, The tag with format `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` and should be made with command `git tag -s v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. The release cadence is around 3 months, might be adjusted based on open source event, but will communicate it clearly.

### Patch releases
Patch releases are based on the major/minor release branch, the release cadence for patch release of recent minor release is one month to solve critical community and security issues. The cadence for patch release of recent minus two minor releases are on-demand driven based on the severity of the issue to be fixed.

### Pre-releases
`Pre-releases:mainly the different RC builds` will be compiled from their corresponding branches. Please note they are done to assist in the stabilization process, no guarantees are provided.

### Minor Release Support Matrix
| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Velero v1.10.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| Velero v1.9.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| Velero v1.8.x   | :white_check_mark: |

### Upgrade path and support policy
The upgrade path for Velero is (1) 2.2.x patch releases are always compatible with its major and minor version. For example, previous released 2.2.x can be upgraded to most recent 2.2.3 release. (2) Velero only supports two previous minor releases to upgrade to current minor release. For example, 2.3.0 will only support 2.1.0 and 2.2.0 to upgrade from, 2.0.0 to 2.3.0 is not supported. One should upgrade to 2.2.0 first, then to 2.3.0.
The Velero project maintains release branches for the three most recent minor releases, each minor release will be maintained for approximately 9 months.

### Next Release
The activity for next release will be tracked in the [Velero Wiki roadmap](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/wiki). If your issue is not present in the corresponding release, please reach out to the maintainers to add the issue to the project board.

### New Features
- All features(Issues and PRs) that are aimed to be completed into the upcoming release must be labeled as `X.YY-cadidate`, where X.YY is the upcoming version.
- Velero maintainers regularly triage the issues labelled with `X.YY-candidate`. The ones which will be planned for ‘X.YY’ release, maintainers will add milestone X.YY and remove `X.YY-candidate` label from them.
- After the feature freeze date for the X.YY release, `X.YY-candidate` label will be removed from all the issues. Maintainers may re-label these issues for next Velero release candidate. The decision will be made by the major stakeholders(maintainers).

Although Velero is supported by many companies, the Velero community is the core of new features and effort to make the project better and feature rich and more reliable with ever other release.

### Publishing a New Release

The following steps outline what to do when its time to plan for and publish a release. Depending on the release (major/minor/patch), not all the following items are needed.

1. Prepare information about what's new in the release.
  * For every release, update documentation for changes that have happened in the release. See the [velero/site](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/site) repo for more details on how to create documentation for a release. All documentation for a release should be published by the time the release is out.
  * For every release, write release notes. See [previous releases](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases) for examples of what to included in release notes.
  * For a major/minor release, write a blog post that highlights new features in the release. Plan to publish this the same day as the release. Highlight the themes, or areas of focus, for the release. Some examples of themes are security, bug fixes, feature improvements. If there are any new features or workflows introduced in a release, consider writing additional blog posts to help users learn about the new features. Plan to publish these after the release date (all blogs don’t have to be publish all at once).
1. Release a new version. Make the new version, docs updates, and blog posts available.
1. Announce the release and thank contributors. We should be doing the following for all releases.
  * In all messages to the community include a brief list of highlights and links to the new release blog, release notes, or download location. Also include shoutouts to community member contribution included in the release.
  * Send an email to the community via the [google group](https://groups.google.com/g/projectvelero)
  * Post a message in the Velero [slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C6VCGP4MT)
  * Post to social media. Maintainers are encouraged to also post or repost from the Velero account to help spread the word.
